## Description

A book search engine which, uses a fully functioning Google Books API search engine. 

The app allows users to search for book titles and save those books to the back end. 

An original APP built with a RESTful API has been refactored with an Apollo Server for use with a GraphQL API. 

The app is built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. 

As part of the assignment an Apollo Server has been installed to run GraphQL queries, with mutations used to fetch and modify data.Apollo Provider requests allow communication with an Apollo Server.

The existing authentication middleware has been updated to enable a GraphQL API context.

The REACT built front-end is enhanced by HTML, Javascript and CSS. 

It has been deployed on Heroku with MongoDB Atlas.

Screenshots of the app are also included below.
